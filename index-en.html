    <strong>How do we protect your data?</strong><br>
    To protect the security of your data during transmission, we use encryption procedures corresponding to the current state of technology (e.g., SSL) via HTTPS.
    We and our IT service provider take all statutory precautions to protect your personal data against loss, destruction, falsification, manipulation, and unauthorized access.

    The personal data you enter remains with us until you request its deletion or the purpose for data storage no longer applies (e.g., after your request has been fully processed). Mandatory legal provisions - especially retention periods - remain unaffected.
    <br>
    <br>

    <strong>Social Networks</strong><br>
    We use the typical icons of social networks on our websites. We have configured these elements so that they are deactivated by default. If you activate them (by clicking), the operators of the respective social networks can register that you are on our website and can use this information for their purposes. The processing of your personal data is then the responsibility of this operator according to their data protection regulations. We do not receive any information about you from them.
